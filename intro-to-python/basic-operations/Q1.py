Then to concatenate them together as one whole string




E:

  Input:

    'John Doe'

D:

  Data:
    str



A:

  Create a variable called first_name equal to the string 'Donovan'
  Create a variable called last_name equal to the string 'Abad'

  then we will use the print function inside the parentheses we will have first_name plus a empty string space plus last_name



C:
'''

first_name = 'Donovan'
last_name = 'Abad'

print(first_name + ' ' + last_name)
