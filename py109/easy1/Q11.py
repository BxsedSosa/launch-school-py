Q11. Write a function that determines and returns the UTF-16 string value of a string passed in as an argument. The UTF-16 string value is the sum of the UTF-16 values of every character in the string. (You may use ord to determine the UTF-17 value of a character)

"""
Created a function called `utf16_value` with the parameter called stirng. Created a variable called `utf16_total` equal to 0 which will be the end result of each utf ord added to this. 

Created a for loop iterating over the string parameter and each iteration will add the ord value of each character to the total then return `utf16_total`
